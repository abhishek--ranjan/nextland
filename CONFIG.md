# Configuration Philosophy

- **Zero config for demo:**
  - The app runs out-of-the-box with mock data and no environment variables required.
  - All demo data is stored in the `data/` folder.

- **Production config:**
  - Use environment variables for secrets, database, and storage settings.
  - See `.env.example` for required variables.
